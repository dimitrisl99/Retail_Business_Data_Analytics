# Jean.gr Retail Analytics Project
This project simulates a real retail analytics environment for a fashion store, **Jean.gr**.  
It demonstrates how data can be collected, transformed, and analyzed to support business decisions using **SQL** and **Power BI**.

‚ö†Ô∏è All datasets used in this project are **fictional** and created solely for learning and demonstration purposes.

## üìä Project Objectives  

- Build a **data pipeline** from Google Sheets to PostgreSQL and Power BI.  
- Design a clean **data model** to support reporting and performance insights.  
- Develop **interactive dashboards** for retail decision-making.  
- Demonstrate **ETL (Extract‚ÄìTransform‚ÄìLoad)** and **data visualization** best practices. 


## üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources  

All raw data were stored in **Google Sheets** and include the following tables:

| Sheet Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **General Info** | Sales per day, time range, temperature, and weather. |
| **Customer** | Customer demographics and location (Greece or Abroad). |
| **Product** | Product details including brand, category, and size. |
| **Payment** | Payment method and discount information. |

Each sheet is published as a CSV endpoint and imported into PostgreSQL via COPY FROM PROGRAM (curl).

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The Google Sheets are **published as public CSV links**, which are automatically loaded into PostgreSQL through the [`refresh_from_sheets.sql`](./refresh_from_sheets.sql) script.  
> These public CSV endpoints ensure that anyone can **replicate the project** end-to-end without local files.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure  

Database: **retail_project**  
Schema: **retail**

Scripts included in the project:

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `01_create_schema.sql` | Creates database schema and base tables. |
| `02_staging_tables.sql` | Loads raw data from CSV files (staging layer). |
| `03_clean_views.sql` | Cleans and transforms data for analysis. |
| `04_fact_kpi_views.sql` | Creates KPI and analytical views. |
| `refresh_from_sheets.sql` | Refreshes the data whenever Google Sheets are updated. |

## üß† The Analysis

This section explains the design choices behind each SQL layer of the project:  
from raw ingestion via Google Sheets to a clean fact view (`retail.v_sales_fct`) consumed by Power BI.  
The focus is on data quality, consistency, and keeping all business logic in SQL ‚Äî not in the BI layer.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Schema & Staging (`01_create_schema.sql`)

**Goal:**  
Create a clean structure (`retail` schema) and staging tables to safely store the raw CSVs imported from Google Sheets.

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA retail;
SET search_path TO retail, public;

CREATE TABLE retail.stg_general_info (
  sales_id     INTEGER,
  day          DATE,
  time         TEXT,
  temperature  NUMERIC,
  weather      TEXT
);

-- Verify table creation
SELECT * FROM retail.stg_general_info LIMIT 0;

-- Load data from Google Sheets (published as CSV)
TRUNCATE retail.stg_general_info;

COPY retail.stg_general_info (sales_id, day, time, temperature, weather)
FROM PROGRAM 'curl -sSL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSajsHDqOE_iUmbsgYrQNdC9y1BjXlnqeS1w2qL8k5owlfYOycDEBJhlqFVRCmVuFvwSHWVRMp-VGJe/pub?gid=63291827&single=true&output=csv"'
WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', QUOTE '"', ESCAPE '"', ENCODING 'UTF8');

```

### üóÇÔ∏è 2. Staging Tables (`02_staging_tables.sql`) 

**Goal:**  
Create separate staging tables for each entity (Customer, Product, Sales, and Payment) to structure raw data before transformation.  
Each table represents a distinct data domain in the retail sales process.
```sql
CREATE TABLE retail.stg_customer (
  customer_id  INTEGER,
  gender       TEXT,
  age          INTEGER,
  country      TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE retail.stg_customer_sale (
  sales_id     INTEGER,
  customer_id  INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE retail.stg_product (
  sale_id      INTEGER,    
  product_id   TEXT,
  category     TEXT,
  brand        TEXT,
  size         TEXT,
  color        TEXT,
  season       TEXT,
  discount_raw TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE retail.stg_payment (
  sales_id       INTEGER,
  payment_method TEXT
);

-- Verify table creation
SELECT 1 FROM retail.stg_customer      LIMIT 0;
SELECT 1 FROM retail.stg_customer_sale LIMIT 0;
SELECT 1 FROM retail.stg_product       LIMIT 0;
SELECT 1 FROM retail.stg_payment       LIMIT 0;

-- Load data from Google Sheets (published as CSV)

-- 1) CUSTOMER
TRUNCATE retail.stg_customer;
COPY retail.stg_customer (customer_id, gender, age, country)
FROM PROGRAM 'curl -sSL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSajsHDqOE_iUmbsgYrQNdC9y1BjXlnqeS1w2qL8k5owlfYOycDEBJhlqFVRCmVuFvwSHWVRMp-VGJe/pub?gid=1121665675&single=true&output=csv"'
WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', QUOTE '"', ESCAPE '"', ENCODING 'UTF8');

-- 2) CUSTOMER SALE
TRUNCATE retail.stg_customer_sale;
COPY retail.stg_customer_sale (sales_id, customer_id)
FROM PROGRAM 'curl -sSL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSajsHDqOE_iUmbsgYrQNdC9y1BjXlnqeS1w2qL8k5owlfYOycDEBJhlqFVRCmVuFvwSHWVRMp-VGJe/pub?gid=785230360&single=true&output=csv"'
WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', QUOTE '"', ESCAPE '"', ENCODING 'UTF8');

-- 3) PRODUCT
TRUNCATE retail.stg_product;
COPY retail.stg_product (sale_id, product_id, category, brand, size, color, season, discount_raw)
FROM PROGRAM 'curl -sSL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSajsHDqOE_iUmbsgYrQNdC9y1BjXlnqeS1w2qL8k5owlfYOycDEBJhlqFVRCmVuFvwSHWVRMp-VGJe/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv"'
WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', QUOTE '"', ESCAPE '"', ENCODING 'UTF8');

-- 4) PAYMENT
TRUNCATE retail.stg_payment;
COPY retail.stg_payment (sales_id, payment_method)
FROM PROGRAM 'curl -sSL "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSajsHDqOE_iUmbsgYrQNdC9y1BjXlnqeS1w2qL8k5owlfYOycDEBJhlqFVRCmVuFvwSHWVRMp-VGJe/pub?gid=1786090900&single=true&output=csv"'
WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', QUOTE '"', ESCAPE '"', ENCODING 'UTF8');

-- Validate data load
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail.stg_customer;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail.stg_customer_sale;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail.stg_product;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail.stg_payment;
``` 

### üßπ 3. Data Cleaning & Transformation (`03_clean_views.sql`) 

**Goal:**  
Transform all staging data into standardized, validated views for analytical use.  
This step ensures consistent naming, cleaned text fields, and properly formatted values (e.g. gender, country, payment type).

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW retail.v_customer AS
SELECT
  customer_id,
  CASE
    WHEN lower(trim(gender)) IN ('m','male','Œ¨ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ±œÇ','Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ±œÇ') THEN 'Male'
    WHEN lower(trim(gender)) IN ('f','female','Œ≥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒØŒ∫Œ±','Œ≥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒπŒ∫Œ±') THEN 'Female'
    ELSE 'Other'
  END AS gender,
  age,
  CASE
    WHEN lower(trim(country)) IN ('greece', 'gr', 'ŒµŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ±', 'ŒµŒªŒªŒ±Œ¥Œ±') THEN 'Greece'
    WHEN lower(trim(country)) IN ('abroad', 'ŒµŒæœâœÑŒµœÅŒπŒ∫Œø', 'ŒµŒæœâœÑŒµœÅŒπŒ∫œå') THEN 'Abroad'
    ELSE NULL
  END AS country
FROM retail.stg_customer
WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Validation
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM retail.v_customer;
SELECT * FROM retail.v_customer LIMIT 5;
```
### üìä 4. Fact Table & KPI Views (`04_fact_kpi_views.sql`)

**Goal:**  
Combine all cleaned views (customer, product, general info, payment) into a single **fact table** for analysis in Power BI.  
This layer centralizes all business metrics and enables KPI aggregation per day, product, and customer.

---

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW retail.v_customer_sale AS
SELECT 
  sales_id,
  customer_id
FROM retail.stg_customer_sale
WHERE sales_id IS NOT NULL 
  AND customer_id IS NOT NULL;
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW retail.v_sales_fct AS
SELECT
  gi.sales_id,
  gi.day,
  gi.time_range,
  gi.temperature,
  gi.weather,
  cs.customer_id,
  c.gender,
  c.age,
  c.country,
  p.product_id,
  p.category,
  p.brand,
  p.size,
  p.color,
  p.season,
  p.has_discount,
  pay.payment_method
FROM retail.v_product p
LEFT JOIN retail.v_general_info gi ON gi.sales_id = p.sale_id
LEFT JOIN retail.v_customer_sale cs ON cs.sales_id = p.sale_id
LEFT JOIN retail.v_customer c       ON c.customer_id = cs.customer_id
LEFT JOIN retail.v_payment pay      ON pay.sales_id = p.sale_id;

-- Validation
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail.v_sales_fct;
SELECT * FROM retail.v_sales_fct LIMIT 10;
```

### üîÑ 5. Automated Data Refresh (`refresh_from_sheets.sql`)

**Goal:**  
Automatically refresh all staging tables in PostgreSQL directly from **Google Sheets** (published as CSV).  
This allows live data updates ‚Äî once new rows are added in Google Sheets, you simply re-run this script and then refresh Power BI.

---

```sql
-- REFRESH DATA FROM GOOGLE SHEETS  (run as superuser)

SET datestyle TO 'DMY';

-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ CUSTOMER
TRUNCATE retail.stg_customer;
COPY retail.stg_customer (customer_id, gender, age, country)

## üìà Power BI Dashboards  

The Power BI report is divided into several pages, each answering a specific business question:

| Page | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Year Overview** | High-level KPIs ‚Äì total sales, customers, top categories. |
| **Previous Day Reports** | Compares sales and customer behavior day-to-day. |
| **Per Brand** | Highlights the performance of each brand. |
| **Does it worth it?** | Evaluates if opening earlier (9‚Äì10 AM) is profitable. |
| **Meet Our Typical Customer** | Identifies customer demographics and behavior. |
| **When Does It Pay to Have Staff?** | Finds the best weekday and hour combinations for staffing. |

---

## üßÆ DAX Measures & Calculated Columns  

Below are some of the key **DAX calculations** used across the dashboards:

| Measure / Column | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Total Sales** = `COUNT('retail_v_sales_fct'[sales_id])` | Counts total sales transactions. |
| **Avg Sales per Customer** = `DIVIDE([Total Sales], DISTINCTCOUNT('retail_v_sales_fct'[customer_id]))` | Calculates the average number of sales per unique customer. |
| **Total Customers** = `DISTINCTCOUNT('retail_v_sales_fct'[customer_id])` | Total number of customers per selected period. |
| **Sales (9‚Äì10)** = `CALCULATE([Total Sales], 'retail_v_sales_fct'[time_range] = "9-10")` | Filters total sales during the 9‚Äì10 AM slot. |
| **Days with NO Sales (9‚Äì10)** = `CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('retail_v_sales_fct'[day]), [Sales (9‚Äì10)] = 0)` | Counts how many days had no sales in the 9‚Äì10 AM range. |
| **DayOfWeek** = `FORMAT('retail_v_sales_fct'[day], "dddd")` | Converts date to weekday name for weekly analysis. |
| **HourOrder** = `VALUE(LEFT('retail_v_sales_fct'[time_range], FIND("-", 'retail_v_sales_fct'[time_range]) - 1))` | Extracts the first hour from the time range for sorting. |
| **Avg Temperature** = `AVERAGE('retail_v_sales_fct'[temperature])` | Calculates average daily temperature. |
| **Avg Weather Condition** = `SELECTEDVALUE('retail_v_sales_fct'[weather])` | Returns the dominant weather type for the selected day/time. |

üìå *These DAX measures support key visuals such as:*
- Sales per Hour & Avg Sales per Customer (Combo chart)
- ‚ÄúDoes it worth it?‚Äù early opening analysis
- Weather & Sales correlation table
- Typical Customer demographics card
- Best Day/Hour for staffing visualization
